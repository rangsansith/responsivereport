# The Responsive Report

**A newsletter from [@innovati](//twitter.com/innovati) about web & design**

---

Hi, my name's [Tommy](//twitter.com/innovati). I’m a designer and developer having fun exploring new technologies and design concepts with CSS and JavaScript.

You might know me from my experiments with [EQCSS](/eqcss/eqcss) and Container Queries, or from my [demos on CodePen](//codepen.io/tomhodgins/pens/popular/). I build websites and research new design ideas. I also make videos and write blog posts about the new techniques I discover, and sometimes I build plugins and demos to help people use the techniques I find.

If you want to follow me on my journey as I experiment with new concepts, learn about new design techniques, and be the first to know about the software I'm building, sign up at [responsivereport.com](//responsivereport.com)
